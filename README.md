### AWS

There are numerous ways to deploy a honeypot on AWS. The most common way is to use an EC2 instance. The following steps will guide you through the process of deploying a honeypot on AWS using an EC2 instance.

description of possible AWS services that can be used to deploy a honeypot

1. EC2
   EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 instances can be used to deploy honeypots by creating a virtual server that can be configured to act as a honeypot.
2. Lambda
   AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is designed to run code in response to events and automatically manage the compute resources required by that code. Lambda functions can be used to deploy honeypots by running code that simulates a honeypot and captures malicious activity.
3. S3
   Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. S3 buckets can be used to deploy honeypots by storing data that is collected by the honeypot and analyzing it for malicious activity.

#### Steps

1. **Create an AWS account**: If you don't have an AWS account, you can create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. **Launch an EC2 instance**:

   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Click on the "Services" dropdown menu and select "EC2".
   - Click on the "Launch Instance" button.
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). You can choose any AMI you want, but it is recommended to choose an AMI that is pre-configured with a honeypot. Some popular honeypot AMIs are [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) and [t-pot](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce).

3. **Configure the instance**:

   - Choose an instance type. The instance type you choose will depend on the resources you need for your honeypot.
   - Configure the instance details. You can leave the default settings or customize them to fit your needs.
   - Add storage. You can add additional storage if needed.
   - Add tags. You can add tags to your instance to help you identify it later.
   - Configure security groups. You will need to configure the security group to allow traffic to and from your honeypot. You can create a new security group or use an existing one.

4. **Launch the instance**:

   - Review your instance settings and click on the "Launch" button.
   - Create a new key pair or use an existing one to connect to your instance.
   - Click on the "Launch Instances" button.

5. **Connect to the instance**:

   - Once your instance is running, you can connect to it using SSH.
   - Open a terminal window and run the following command to connect to your instance:

   ```
   ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
   ```

   - Replace `/path/to/your/key.pem` with the path to your key pair and `your-instance-public-dns` with the public DNS of your instance.
